# Email Verification Solution Testing Guide

This document provides steps to test the email verification solution that was implemented to fix the issue where users couldn't log in after registration due to missing verification emails.

## Test Steps

1. **Register a new account**
   - Navigate to the registration page
   - Fill in your details and create an account
   - You should be redirected to a success page with a message about email verification
   - Click "Go to Login Page"

2. **Verify the account (Development Mode)**
   - On the login page, enter the email you registered with
   - You should see an error message about verification
   - Use the "Verify Email (Dev Only)" button which appears below the error message
   - You should see a success toast message indicating that the email is now verified

3. **Log in to the account**
   - Enter your email and password
   - You should now be able to log in successfully

## Expected Results

- The registration process should complete without errors
- The verification button should appear on login when needed
- After verification, login should work correctly
- You should be redirected to the dashboard after successful login

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Make sure both server and client are running in development mode
2. Check the browser console for any errors
3. Verify the server logs to see if the verification endpoint is being called correctly
4. Ensure the NODE_ENV is set to "development" on the server
