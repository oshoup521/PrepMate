### Installation

#### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the server directory:
   ```bash
   cd server
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the server directory (use `.env.example` as a template):
   ```powershell
   Copy-Item .env.example .env
   ```
   Then edit the `.env` file to add your Gemini API key (obtain from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)) and adjust other settings as needed.

4. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm run start:dev
   ```

#### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the client directory:
   ```bash
   cd client
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the client directory (use `.env.example` as a template):
   ```powershell
   Copy-Item .env.example .env
   ```
   Then edit the `.env` file to configure the app settings if needed.

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Backend Deployment

1. Create a new Web Service on your preferred platform
2. Connect your GitHub repository
3. Configure the build settings:
   - Build Command: `cd server && npm install && npm run build`
   - Start Command: `cd server && npm run start:prod`

### CORS Configuration

For proper cross-origin requests between your frontend and backend:

1. Make sure the `CORS_ORIGIN` environment variable on your backend matches exactly with the URL of your frontend deployment
2. If you're experiencing CORS issues:
   - Check network requests in browser developer tools
   - Verify that your backend is correctly configured to accept requests from your frontend origin
   - Make sure your frontend's API URL is properly configured in the client's environment variables
